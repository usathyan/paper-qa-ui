   - **Top Result**: "The role of PTB domain containing adaptor proteins on PICALM-mediated APP endocytosis and localization" (2019, 13 citations)
   - **Key Finding**: PICALM is involved in APP endocytosis, directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease

2. **"PICALM Alzheimer's disease genetics"** - Found 4,304 papers
   - **Top Result**: "Genome-wide association study identifies variants at CLU and PICALM associated with Alzheimer's disease" (2009, 1,760 citations)
   - **Key Finding**: PICALM is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease

3. **"PICALM amyloid beta"** - Found 35,625 papers
   - **Top Result**: "The concerted amyloid-beta clearance of LRP1 and ABCB1/P-gp across the blood-brain barrier is linked by PICALM" (2018, 99 citations)
   - **Key Finding**: PICALM is involved in amyloid-beta clearance across the blood-brain barrier

### üéØ **Most Relevant Papers Found**

1. **"PICALM and Alzheimer's Disease: An Update and Perspectives"** (2022, 53 citations)
   - **Venue**: Cells
   - **Key Point**: PICALM is the most significant genetic risk factor identified by GWAS

2. **"Decreasing the expression of PICALM reduces endocytosis and the activity of Œ≤-secretase: implications for Alzheimer's disease"** (2016, 52 citations)
   - **Venue**: BMC Neuroscience
   - **Key Point**: PICALM directly affects Œ≤-secretase activity

3. **"Level of PICALM, a key component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is correlated with levels of phosphotau and autophagy-related proteins"** (2016, 60 citations)
   - **Venue**: Neurobiology of Disease
   - **Key Point**: PICALM levels correlate with tau pathology

## üîç **Search Strategy Insights**

### **Effective Queries**
- ‚úÖ "PICALM endocytosis" - Very specific, high relevance
- ‚úÖ "PICALM Alzheimer's disease genetics" - Found seminal GWAS paper
- ‚úÖ "PICALM amyloid beta" - Found clearance mechanism papers

### **Less Effective Queries**
- ‚ùå "PICALM protein structure" - Too broad, found general protein structure papers
- ‚ùå "PICALM therapeutic target" - Too broad, found general therapeutic papers

### **Rate Limiting Issues**
- **Problem**: Without API key, hit rate limits frequently
- **Solution**: Implemented 2-second delays between requests
- **Recommendation**: Get Semantic Scholar API key for higher rate limits

## üöÄ **Recommendations for Paper-QA Integration**

### **1. Query Optimization**
Based on successful searches, use these specific query patterns:
- `"PICALM endocytosis"`
- `"PICALM Alzheimer's disease"`
- `"PICALM amyloid beta clearance"`
- `"PICALM genetic risk factor"`

### **2. Rate Limiting Strategy**
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
- Use API keys when available
- Cache results to reduce API calls

### **3. Result Filtering**
- Filter for papers with "PICALM" in title or abstract
- Prioritize papers with higher citation counts
- Focus on recent papers (2015-2024) for current research

### **4. Specific Research Areas Found**
1. **Endocytosis**: PICALM's role in APP endocytosis
2. **Genetics**: GWAS associations with Alzheimer's risk
3. **Amyloid Clearance**: Blood-brain barrier transport
4. **Tau Pathology**: Correlation with phosphotau levels
5. **Œ≤-secretase**: Direct effect on amyloid production

## üìà **Success Metrics**
- **Total Papers Found**: 30+ relevant papers
- **Relevance Rate**: ~60% of papers mention PICALM specifically
- **Citation Range**: 0-1,760 citations
- **Year Range**: 2009-2024
- **Top Venues**: Nature Genetics, BMC Neuroscience, Neurobiology of Disease

## üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **API Endpoint**: `/paper/search`
- **Fields Retrieved**: title, abstract, year, citationCount, url, venue, authors
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second intervals between requests
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic for 429 errors

## üí° **Next Steps**
1. **Get API Key**: Apply for Semantic Scholar API key for higher rate limits
2. **Implement Caching**: Cache search results to improve performance
3. **Query Expansion**: Use successful query patterns in Paper-QA
4. **Result Ranking**: Implement relevance scoring based on PICALM mentions
5. **Integration**: Integrate these search strategies into the main Paper-QA system
