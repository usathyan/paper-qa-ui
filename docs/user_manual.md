## 💡 How to Ask Great Research Questions

### ✅ Good Questions (Get Better Answers)
- **Specific**: "What are the side effects of metformin in Type 2 diabetes?"
- **Clear context**: "How does tau protein aggregation contribute to neurodegeneration?"
- **Use scientific terms**: "What is the mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors?"

### ❌ Avoid These Question Types
- **Too broad**: "Tell me about cancer" 
- **Yes/no questions**: "Is aspirin good?"
- **Vague terms**: "What's the best drug?"

### 🎯 Research Question Examples by Field

## 🎯 Research Workflow Examples

### Literature Review Workflow
1. Start with broad question: "What are current Alzheimer's treatments?"
2. Narrow down: "What are the mechanisms of aducanumab?"
3. Get specific: "What were the clinical trial results for aducanumab?"
4. Compare: "How does aducanumab compare to other amyloid therapies?"

### Drug Development Workflow
1. Target validation: "What evidence supports BACE1 as an Alzheimer's target?"
2. Competitive landscape: "What BACE1 inhibitors are in development?"
3. Clinical status: "What clinical trials exist for BACE1 inhibitors?"
4. Safety profile: "What are the side effects of BACE1 inhibition?"

### Grant Writing Workflow
1. Background: "What is the current understanding of tau pathology?"
2. Gap analysis: "What are the limitations of current tau therapies?"
3. Innovation: "What novel approaches to tau targeting exist?"
4. Significance: "What is the clinical need for tau-based therapies?"

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

### "I cannot answer this question"
**Why this happens:**
- Question too vague or broad
- No relevant papers found
- Technical issues with search

**What to do:**
