  "question": "explain the effects of PICALM on alzheimers",
  "answer": "PICALM plays a complex and multifaceted role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, influencing both amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies, as well as other cellular processes relevant to the disease (Ando2022 pages 12-13, Ando2022 pages 19-20).\n\n**Effects on Amyloid-Beta (Aβ) Pathology:**\n*   **Aβ Production:** PICALM is thought to regulate APP processing by forming complexes that promote the degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) through autophagy, thereby reducing Aβ production (Ando2022 pages 12-13). It also interacts with the γ-secretase complex and modulates BACE1 expression, both of which are involved in APP processing (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n*   **Aβ Clearance:** PICALM is involved in the internalization and clearance of Aβ bound to LRP1, a key Aβ receptor, via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n*   **Aβ-Mediated Neurotoxicity:** PICALM may indirectly affect Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, potentially by interacting with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are implicated in excitotoxicity in neurons vulnerable in AD (Ando2022 pages 12-13). Some studies suggest a protective role of PICALM orthologues against Aβ toxicity, while others indicate it might enhance toxicity, with these discrepancies possibly due to variations in Aβ species and expression levels (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n\n**Effects on Tau Pathology:**\n*   **Tau Degradation:** PICALM modulates tau degradation through autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion (Ando2022 pages 14-16). Knockdown of PICALM can accelerate the accumulation of phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) by impairing autophagy (Ando2022 pages 14-16). Conversely, PICALM overexpression might promote tau-mediated neurodegeneration (Ando2022 pages 14-16).\n*   **Tau Pathology Progression:** PICALM protein levels are reduced in affected brain areas in tauopathies, negatively correlating with hyperphosphorylated tau. This reduction may be due to cleavage by calpain and caspase-3, enzymes activated in AD and other tauopathies (Ando2022 pages 13-14). PICALM may also be involved in the propagation of tau pathology, potentially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and interaction with LRP1 (Ando2022 pages 14-16).\n\n**Other Roles and Dysregulation in AD:**\n*   **Genetic Association:** PICALM is identified as one of the most significant susceptibility genes for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) (Ando2022 pages 2-3). Genetic variants in PICALM are associated with AD risk (Karch2015 pages 9-10, Ando2022 pages 20-21, Karch2015 pages 10-11).\n*   **Cellular Processes:** PICALM is involved in various cellular functions crucial for neuronal health, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, cholesterol and iron homeostasis, synaptic functions, glutamatergic transmission, and lipid metabolism (Ando2022 pages 19-20, Ando2022 pages 3-5, Ando2022 pages 17-19).\n*   **Expression Changes:** PICALM expression is dysregulated in AD brains. While mRNA levels may increase, total protein levels often decrease, particularly in microvessels. PICALM is upregulated in microglia but decreased in endothelial cells in AD brains (Ando2022 pages 13-14). Neuronal PICALM labeling increases and is associated with neurofibrillary tangles (Ando2022 pages 13-14).\n*   **Post-Translational Modifications:** PICALM undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may be dysregulated in AD brains and affect its function (Ando2022 pages 6-7).\n\nIn summary, PICALM is a key player in AD pathogenesis, impacting the production and clearance of Aβ, the progression of tau pathology, and various cellular homeostatic mechanisms. Its dysregulation and genetic associations highlight its significance in the disease (pqac-a3df51d7, pqac-b138996e, Ando2022 pages 2-3).",

      "text": "                     regulatory mechanisms of PICALM expression, miR-155 may provide a key pathway to\n                           untangle the divergence of mRNA and protein levels of PICALM. It would be intriguing to\n                     ﬁnd correlation between the PICALM level and miR-155 in further studies. In addition,\n                              post-transcriptional regulatory effects of other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding\n                 RNA and circular RNA on PICALM, need to be investigated in AD models. The last but\n                            not least hypothesis to explain the divergence of mRNA and protein levels is that PICALM\n                    may undergo abnormally accelerated proteolysis in AD brains. Several lines of evidence\n                            suggest that PICALM is cleaved by both calpain and caspase [33,79,80], which are activated\n                              in AD brains [138]. Moreover, post-translational modiﬁcations of PICALM might affect its\n                            degradation, stabilization, protein–protein interaction or subcellular localization, yet such\n                                 effects remain largely elusive. Further studies are thus necessary to decipher the potential\n                            abnormalities of PICALM post-translational modiﬁcations using 2D Western blot analyses\n                       and mass spectrometry from control and AD brain samples to search for AD-speciﬁc\n                              post-translational modiﬁcations of PICALM and their implications in pathology.\n\n                                   4.2. Challenges in Deciphering the Effect of PICALM Variants on Its Expression\n\n                                Several independent studies have recently reported a signiﬁcant association of the\n                           LOAD-susceptibility PICALM risk variants (rs10792832 and rs3851179 that are in full LD)\n                       on the decreased expression in microglial cells [90,91]. It should be highly informative\n                              to create AD models in which microglial PICALM expression is modulated in order to\n                           unravel the effect of reduced or increased PICALM expression in microglia.\n                                 Additionally, in iPSC-derived endothelial cells, the protective rs3851179T allele is\n                              associated with increased mRNA and protein expression of PICALM [34] and in bulk tissues\n                     when analyzed relative to cell-speciﬁc mRNA markers for microvessels and neurons [30].\n                        Given that the effect of rs3851179T is rather modest when normalized to astrocyte marker\n                    GFAP (glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein), it becomes more remarkable when normalized to\n                            endothelial cell markers or neuronal markers [30]. Therefore, it is possible that PICALM\n                             variants may have distinct effects on its expression in different cell types.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            18 of 26\n\n\n\n                            To decipher the inconsistencies in mRNA and protein levels of PICALM observed\n                              in postmortem human AD brain samples [124], the PICALM levels in each cell type\n                                    (e.g., microglia, neuron, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, etc.) should be analyzed in large\n                              scale diverse cohorts by high throughput single cell sequencing and further validated by\n                         RT-qPCR, Western blotting, mass-spectrometry (in distinct cell-type fractions) and by in situ\n                             hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry (in sections) of postmortem human AD brain\n                         samples [167]. As shown by Zhao et al., on the functional effect of rs3851179 on PICALM\n                            expression in iPSC-derived endothelial cells, it should be interesting to differentiate iPSC\n                              isogenic for rs3851179T/C into various cell types to examine the expression level of PICALM\n                              in distinct cell types. More work is necessary to increase the number of samples from\n                                different cohorts to improve the power of statistical analyses and pursue proteomic analyses\n                            considering heterogeneous cell populations in the brain.\n\n                                   4.3. Potential Role of PICALM in Cellular Homeostasis\n                       PICALM is involved in various pathological processes, such as Aβ production and\n                               transcytosis, as well as tau pathology progression (Figure 7). Given that PICALM plays\n                               versatile roles in iron homeostasis, glutaminergic neurotransmission [117], endocytosis,\n                        and autophagy, PICALM may as well be implicated in the “cellular phase” of AD proposed\n                       by Bart De Strooper and Eric Karran [168]. In this hypothesis, they propose that the\n                          accumulation of amyloid and tau pathologies at the biochemical phase is rather tolerated\n                        by neuronal cells. However, the clinical signs manifest only when the cellular homeostatic\n                       mechanisms fail along with dysfunction of the neurovascular unit, abnormal neuronal\n                         network activity and dyshomeostasis of astrocytes and microglial cells. PICALM and other\n                           endocytic proteins encoded by AD susceptibility genes may be implicated in such steps\n                              that lead to dysfunction and breakdown of ﬁnely tuned cellular physiological functions.\n                    PICALM may be a small piece of complex endocytic machinery that may be vulnerable to\n                           neurodegeneration [169].\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Figure 7. Effects of PICALM on AD pathogenesis pathways and neurodegeneration. PICALM is\n                             involved in multiple pathways of AD pathogenesis. PICALM regulates pathways related to APP\n                               processing and Aβ-related neurodegeneration (shown in pink). PICALM plays critical role related to\n                              both tau and Aβ pathologies, such as cholesterol dyshomeostasis, inﬂammation, iron dyshomeostasis\n                         and autophagy (yellow). PICALM is also crucial for neuronal toxicity via glial lipid transport,\n                               synaptic functions, glutaminergic transmission and modifying Aβ-toxicity (blue).Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            19 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   5.

PICALM-immunoreactive microglial cells were faintly detected in control brains\n                              (arrowheads) (D), and the number and the intensity of PICALM-stained microglia were increased in\n                    LOAD (D) (arrowheads). In FAD (F) brains, the increase in PICALM immunostained microglial cells\n                         was less prominent than in LOAD. More detailed data can be found in our article [33].

Scale bar 20 µm.\n\n                                 Studies in PICALM+/−mice suggest that 50% of PICALM reduction did not trigger a\n                                clear motor phenotype or any detectable tau pathology for at least up to 12 months [54,135].\n                   On the contrary, PICALM heteroinsufﬁciency aggravates tau pathology in a tau trans-\n                           genic mouse model. By crossing Tg30 overexpressing human double mutant tau (P301S\n                       and G272V) transgenic mice developing an age-dependent tau pathology [141] with\n                      PICALM+/−mice [54], we generated a novel transgenic mouse line Tg30xPICALM+/−[135].\n                        Tg30xPICALM+/−exhibited an aggravation of motor deﬁcits and tau pathology, suggesting\n                              that a reduction of PICALM in the presence of tau pathology may induce deﬁcits in the\n                         autophagy pathway [135]. It should be emphasized that this model develops a tau pathol-\n                        ogy at least partially in a cell-autonomous manner due to a tau transgene bearing double\n                          FTLD-related mutations [141]. Since MAPT gene mutations are not linked to AD, further\n                             studies are required to decipher the role of PICALM in the development and propagation\n                              of non-mutant tau.\n\n                                   3.3.4. PICALM and Tau Pathology Propagation\n\n                                  In AD brains, tau pathology develops in a stereotypical manner across neuroanatomi-\n                                cally connected networks [142]. Given that tau pathology propagates, at least partially, via\n                            clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [143], a clathrin adaptor such as PICALM may be\n                           involved in clathrin-mediated tau internalization.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            16 of 26\n\n\n\n                                  In addition to the prominent role of LRP1 in Aβ clearance [144], recent studies suggest\n                            the involvement of LRP1 in regulating tau seeding and internalization [145]. LRP1 is\n                           expressed in neuronal, glial and endothelial cells [146]. The afﬁnity of the tau microtubule-\n                          binding domain to LRP1 is high under physiological conditions, while hyperphospho-\n                              rylation of tau leads to a reduction of its binding afﬁnity to LRP1 [147]. Therefore, their\n                               interaction may be weaker in AD brains. Since PICALM directly binds to LRP1 to regulate\n                             the internalization of LRP1 [34], it can be speculated that PICALM modulates pathological\n                            tau spreading via LRP1-mediated pathological tau internalization.\n                        PICALM also modulates cholesterol biogenesis and lipoprotein uptake (see Section 2.1.2).\n                              Cholesterol is implicated in amyloid pathology [148] and is detected in amyloid plaques [149].\n                             Since cholesterol depletion promotes tau uptake and aggregation [150], PICALM-mediated\n                           misregulation of cholesterol homeostasis may be related to both amyloid and tau pathol-\n                        ogy progression.\n                       PICALM is involved in iron uptake via transferrin (see Section 2.1.2). Iron in Fe3+\n                              (redox-inert state) is detected in NFTs of AD [151] and is implicated in tangle formation [152]\n                       and in APP processing [153]. Given PICALM is misregulated in AD brains, the PICALM-\n                         mediated iron uptake may be involved in AD pathogenesis.\n                   A study using the HEK tau biosensor cell model [154] has suggested no effect of\n                             deletion of GWAS hit genes, including PICALM, on the FRET-based signal of tau-tau\n                              interaction [155]. Since a lipofectamine-based method was used for PHF internalization,\n                         Kolay et al., focused on the effect of a GWAS hit gene depletion on FRET-based tau-tau\n                              interaction but not on the effect on the “physiological” uptake of PHF. It remains elusive\n                                          if PICALM overexpression modulates PHF uptake or tau-tau interaction. Further studies\n                             are necessary to assess the role of PICALM in modulating the prion-like tau pathology\n         "

      "text": "sis, researchers have sought to identify the role of PICALM\n                       on Aβ pathology.  Multiple lines of evidence suggest that PICALM regulates APP\n                            processing [35,113–115] and Aβ transcytosis [34].\n                               Tian et al., have reported a rather protective role of PICALM in APP metabolism.\n                    PICALM forms a complex with APP-CTF together with AP2 and microtubule-associated\n                            protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagy marker [115]. The interaction of APP-CTFs,\n                      PICALM, AP2 and LC3 results in transporting APP-CTFs into the autophagosome in which\n                       APP-CTFs are degraded by autophagy. The interaction between APP-CTFs and PICALM\n                          consequently leads to a reduction of Aβ production [114]. This critical role of PICALM\n                              in autophagy is strengthened by another study showing that loss of exon 1 of PICALM\n                              in HeLa cells leads to an augmentation of lysosomal enzymes in the endosome-enriched\n                               fraction and accumulation of autophagy substrates such as APP-CTFs [48].\n                       PICALM regulates APP processing via γ-secretase internalization due to a direct\n                              interaction between the PICALM ANTH domain and Nicastrin, one of the components of\n                             the γ-secretase complex [116]. Intriguingly, PICALM itself modulates APP-CTF production\n                             via controlling BACE1 expression [94].Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            13 of 26\n\n\n\n                                 In addition, PICALM has been reported to be a regulator of PICALM/clathrin-\n                        dependent internalization of Aβ bound to the low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related\n                             protein-1 (LRP1), a major Aβ receptor, leading to Aβ transcytosis and clearance [34].\n                         As there are multiple implications of PICALM in the regulation of Aβ pathology\n                           (autophagy, APP processing, transcytosis), it is not surprising that there are some contra-\n                             dictory observations in transgenic models of amyloid pathology with reduced expression\n                             of PICALM. One study has shown a signiﬁcant increase in amyloid load in PICALM+/−\n                           crossed with APPsw/0 and observed a 3.5-4-fold increase in Aβ load in the 9-month-old\n                     APPsw/0PICALM+/−mouse brain [34]. On the other hand, Kanatsu et al., observed a\n                             signiﬁcant reduction of Aβ load in 12-month-old A7/PICALM+/−mouse brains. Further,\n                          Xiao et al., have reported that PICALM is colocalized with APP and PICALM expression\n                                level has a signiﬁcant impact on Aβ level in APP/PS1 mice injected with adeno-associated\n                            virus (AAV)-mediated modulation of PICALM levels. While PICALM overexpression\n                              increases APP internalization and Aβ production, PICALM knockdown decreases amyloid\n                           load [35]. Furthermore, drosophila PICALM orthologue LAP overexpression did not alter\n                            the Aβ42 level in a drosophila model overexpressing Aβ42 [117]. The discrepancy of the\n                            observation on Aβ production may be related to the different transgenes with distinct mu-\n                               tations and the differences in amyloid doses in the models analyzed. These contradictory\n                           data imply that the effect of PICALM reduction can differ depending on the progression\n                             of Aβ pathology. Further studies are necessary to determine the function of PICALM in\n                    APP processing by using a model close to the physiological conditions of human LOAD to\n                            achieve clinical relevance.\n\n                                   3.2.2. PICALM and Aβ-Mediated Neurotoxicity via Glutaminergic Neurotransmission\n                                  In the yeast model, PICALM orthologue was identiﬁed as a protective modiﬁer of Aβ\n                                toxicity [118]. Overexpression of YAP1802, the yeast orthologue of PICALM, partially res-\n                            cues Aβ-induced toxicity without affecting the secretory pathway. Treusch et al., conﬁrmed\n                            the rescuing effect of PICALM in C. elegans and rat cortical neuronal culture: overexpres-\n                            sion of unc-11, the C. elegans orthologue of PICALM, rescues Aβ-induced glutaminergic\n                         neuron loss in C. elegans and lentiviral PICALM overexpression diminished Aβ-induced\n                        neuron loss in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. On the contrary, D’Angelo and\n                            colleagues observed that mammalian PICALM enhanced Aβ-induced toxicity in a yeast\n                       model overexpressing Aβ tagged with GFP [119]. These inconsistent observations are\n                              partly due to the heterogeneity of the Aβ species and the distinct expression level of Aβ. In\n                              addition, Aβ overexpression in these bio-engineered yeast models was driven by transgene\n                          encoding Aβ, and thus, the nature of overexpressed Aβ should differ from the Aβ peptides\n                           derived from successive cleavages of APP in a physiological/pathophysiological condition\n                              in human brains.\n                                               It is noteworthy that Aβ is not co-immunoprecipitated with PICALM in human brains,\n                        and PICALM immunoreactivity is never observed in the center of amyloid plaques [32–35].\n                          Thus, PICALM may presumably play roles in Aβ-induced toxicity in an indirect manner.\n                     One of the candidate intermediates between PICALM and Aβ is N-methyl-d-aspartate\n                             receptor (NMDAR). Glutaminergic neurons are the most vulnerable subtype of neurons in\n                      AD, and soluble Aβ enhances glutamate release, leading to excessive activation [120,121].\n                           Whilst NMDAR is critical for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, excessive NMDAR\n                             activation leads to excitotoxicity and cell death [122]. A recent study in the drosophila\n                        model of AD has suggested that overexpression of LAP, the drosophila PICALM orthologue,\n                            rescues Aβ42-induced toxicity without affecting Aβ42 level [117].\n\n                              "

The asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif binds to\n                         Eps15 homology (EH) domains found in proteins associated with endocytosis and vesicle\n                             trafﬁcking. Since exon 13 contains one DPF (AP2 binding) and one NPF (EH domain\n                            binding) motif, the splice variant without exon 13 is supposed to have reduced interaction\n                          with AP2 and other protein partners owning EH-domains [43].Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                             7 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   2.3. Post-Translational Modiﬁcations of PICALM\n\n                      PICALM undergoes several post-translational modifications (PTM), such as phos-\n                           phorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and acetylation [65,66,68–74].\n                        These post-translational modifications have been identified on numerous amino acid\n                           residues of PICALM: 41 phosphorylation, 15 ubiquitination, 1 acetylation, 1 mono-\n                            methylation, 1 di-methylation and 1 sumoylation sites have been described so far. Certain\n                              factors are known to induce some of the post-translational modifications on PICALM,\n                         such as phosphorylation by Aβ treatment in primary neuronal culture [75], by BI2536, a\n                               selective inhibitor of protein kinase Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1), inducing phosphorylation\n                           (Y138, T146 and S537) [76], by ischemia (S303 and S315) [77] and by nocodazole, an in-\n                               hibitor of microtubule polymerization (S474 and S645) [78]. The most well-characterized\n                  PTM of PICALM are the four phosphorylation sites (S16, Y96, S107 and S303) and two\n                            ubiquitination sites (K318 and K324) that have been validated by mass-spectrometry\n                      and have been described for more than 5 times [65]. While the phosphorylation on\n                           the ANTH domain may influence the interactions of PICALM with PtdIns(4,5)P2 or\n                    R-SNARE proteins, the other phosphorylation residues are located in the C-terminal\n                             clathrin adaptor domain exhibiting pivotal functions in protein–protein interaction of\n                   PICALM with clathrin and other endocytic machinery proteins. Therefore, it is specu-\n                             lated that phosphorylation of PICALM should play a role in regulating interaction with\n                            PtdIns(4,5)P2 and other protein binding partners. For instance, the R-SNARE binding\n                       domain contains several sites that can undergo PTM, such as one phosphorylation (Y237),\n                       two ubiquitination (K231 and K252) and one sumoylation (K238), and thus, these PTM\n                    may regulate the interaction between PICALM and R-SNARE.\n                       PICALM is a substrate of calpain and caspase [33,79,80]. Nevertheless, it remains\n                              largely unknown if the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of PICALM affect its protein\n                                 stability or degradation.\n                           Given that PICALM contains more than 130 putative phosphorylation sites, PI-\n                 CALM phosphorylation may be dysregulated in AD brains not only in terms of its\n                           global phosphorylation level but also in the pattern of site-specific phosphorylation.\n                          Indeed, Aβ exposure increases PICALM phosphorylation in primary rat neuronal cor-\n                                  tical culture [75] though phosphorylation sites and the involved kinases remain to be\n                              identified. While it is speculated that phosphorylation may change the interaction\n                             of PICALM with its binding partners such as R-SNAREs, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or clathrin,\n                                        it remains elusive which kinases are involved in PICALM phosphorylation, whether\n                   PICALM phosphorylation is misregulated during the progression of AD, whether PI-\n                 CALM phosphorylation has any impact on its protein stability/degradation or its\n                            subcellular localization and whether phosphorylation of PICALM may cause a loss of\n                           function and/or a gain of toxicity.\n\n           "

Glutaminergic neurons are the most vulnerable subtype of neurons in\n                      AD, and soluble Aβ enhances glutamate release, leading to excessive activation [120,121].\n                           Whilst NMDAR is critical for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, excessive NMDAR\n                             activation leads to excitotoxicity and cell death [122]. A recent study in the drosophila\n                        model of AD has suggested that overexpression of LAP, the drosophila PICALM orthologue,\n                            rescues Aβ42-induced toxicity without affecting Aβ42 level [117].\n\n                                   3.3. PICALM and Tau\n                                   3.3.1. PICALM Expression and Localization in AD Brains\n\n                                   Different lines of evidence suggest that PICALM expression is dysregulated during the\n                            progression of AD. Under a physiological condition in the central nervous system (CNS),\n                    PICALM is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types such as endothelial, neuronal andCells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            14 of 26\n\n\n\n                              microglial cells [30,32–36,123]. In AD postmortem brains, however, PICALM may undergo\n                        an alteration of expression levels and protein localizations in distinct cell types.\n                            During the progression of AD, PICALM mRNA expression levels are increased in\n                            the brain [32,124] and in the blood [125] of AD patients. In contrast, the PICALM protein\n                               level in the total bulk tissue is decreased in AD brains [33]. Another study has shown\n                              that PICALM protein level is decreased in the isolated microvessel fraction of AD brains\n                          but is not signiﬁcantly altered in the microvessel-depleted fraction of AD brains [34]. In\n                               line with this discordant observation, Tasaki et al., have recently reported that there is a\n                           general divergence between the levels of transcripts (mRNA) and protein expression in\n                        postmortem AD brain tissue. By mass-spectrometry, they observed a signiﬁcant reduction\n                              of PICALM protein in a correlation with 14.3% faster cognitive decline [124].\n                           Most of the analyses made on PICALM expression were conducted using human\n                        postmortem tissues of the affected brain regions that contain different cell types. Single-\n                                  cell transcriptomic studies have shown that groups of GWAS hit genes, including PI-\n                    CALM, are generally upregulated in microglial cells in correlation with neuronal AD\n                          pathology [126]. While PICALM immunoreactivity in microglial cells is increased in\n                 LOAD brains [33], PICALM immunolabelling is decreased in endothelial cells [30], and\n                   PICALM protein level assessed by Western blot is decreased in the microvessel fraction\n                             of postmortem AD brain tissues [34]. Neuronal PICALM labeling is increased in AD\n                            brains [33,34] and is associated with NFTs (Figure 6A–C) [33]. PICALM and hyperphos-\n                          phorylated tau are co-immunoprecipitated in AD brain lysate [33]. Since pathological\n                           tau in NFTs is ubiquitinated [127], and the ANTH domain of PICALM has an afﬁnity to\n                            ubiquitin [67], the interaction between PICALM and tau needs to be further analyzed in\n                           non-pathological and pathological conditions to determine the role of ubiquitin to form\n                      tau–PICALM complex. Other studies have shown immunoreactivities of PICALM inter-\n                              actors such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 [123,128] and AP2A1 [129] in association with phosphotau in\n                      NFTs and dystrophic neurites. Of note, PICALM is not the only LOAD GWAS hit protein\n                            detected in NFTs: some other proteins encoded by GWAS hits genes are also linked with\n                            tau pathologies such as APOE4 [130], CLU [131], BIN1 [132], TPK2B [133] and AP2A1 [129].\n\n                                   3.3.2. PICALM in Primary Tauopathy Brains\n\n                             To our knowledge, there is no report showing alteration of PICALM mRNA expression\n                               levels in primary tauopathy brains; however, PICALM protein localization is altered in\n                         primary tauopathies with no amyloid pathology [134]. In postmortem human tissues,\n                   PICALM immunoreactivity is associated with pathological tau in the AD brain [33] and\n                              in other tauopathies such as PSP and Pick disease [134].  In NFTs, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and\n                    PICALM are colocalized [123,128]. PICALM protein level is decreased in the affected brain\n                             areas of various tau-related neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, FTLD-tau-MAPT,\n                             corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) diffuse type with tau\n                          pathology [33,134,135]. A signiﬁcant negative correlation was observed between PICALM\n                            protein level and hyperphosphorylated tau or autophagy initiation marker Beclin1 in the\n                         postmortem human frontal cortex of these neurodegenerative diseases [134]. Such reduction\n                               of PICALM seems related to the fact that PICALM is a substrate of both calpain and caspase-\n                          3 [33,79,80] that are activated in the brains of AD and other tauopathies [136–140].\n\n                                   3.3.3. PICALM and Tau in Cellular and Animal Models\n\n                       PICALM modulates tau degradation via both autophagosome formation and au-\n                           tolysosomal fusion in several experimental models, such as cultured cells, drosophila and\n                          zebraﬁsh [51]. Knockdown of PICALM caused accelerated accumulation of phosphotau\n                              in HeLa cells transiently transfected with DsRed-Tau 4R (four repeats) by impairing au-\n                           tophagy. Nonetheless, they observed in the same study that PICALM overexpression\n                         drove tau-mediated neurodegeneration in zebraﬁsh [51]. Thus, they observed that both\n                       knockdown and overexpression of PICALM accelerated neurodegeneration in the presence"

Since a lipofectamine-based method was used for PHF internalization,\n                         Kolay et al., focused on the effect of a GWAS hit gene depletion on FRET-based tau-tau\n                              interaction but not on the effect on the “physiological” uptake of PHF.

PICALM and Glial Cells\n\n                             Evidence suggests that PICALM immunoreactivity in microglial cells is increased\n                              in the postmortem hippocampus of LOAD compared to non-demented controls. Such a\n                               striking increase was not evident in human FAD brains (Figure 6D–F) [33]. These observa-\n                              tions are in line with recent studies showing the potential involvement of glial cells in AD\n                            pathogenesis [156]. Indeed, single cell transcriptome from postmortem AD brains suggests\n                              that a group of genes, including PICALM, APOE, TREM2, MEF2C and the MHC class II\n                          genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5 are upregulated in microglial cells in correlation with\n                 AD pathology [126].\n                        APOE4 carriers exhibit endocytic defects before signiﬁcant amyloid deposition [157].\n                    PICALM is described as a modiﬁer of APOE4-induced endocytic defects in human iPSC-\n                           derived astrocytes and in yeast. PICALM and its yeast orthologue YAP1802 overexpression\n                           rescued APOE4-induced endosomal abnormalities in human iPSC-derived astrocytes and\n                              yeast, respectively [158]. Nonetheless, PICALM immunoreactivity is hardly detected in\n                              astrocytes in postmortem human brain tissues [33], and thus, the implication of PICALM in\n                               astrocytic endocytosis might be an adjunct contributor to AD pathogenesis.\n                              Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce neuronal lipid synthesis\n                             that leads to the sequestration of glial lipid droplets (LD) to delay neurotoxicity [159].\n                   PICALM modulates this neuroprotective process of neuron-to-glia lipid transport.\n                    PICALM orthologue LAP knockdown in drosophila glia leads to a significantly reduced\n                   LD formation. PICALM knockdown in rat astrocytes leads to reduced uptake of neuron-\n                         derived fatty acids [159]. PICALM and other proteins encoded by LOAD GWAS hits\n                      (APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, AP2A2 and RIN3) are thus involved in LD formation and/or\n                           neuron-glial lipid transfer pathway, and knockdown of PICALM leads to blunted\n                              lipid transfer.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            17 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   4. Discussion\n                                   4.1. Difﬁculties in Interpreting Expression Levels of PICALM in AD Brains\n\n                              Cautions need to be taken to interpret the data about PICALM expression in human\n                         autopsy tissues. The results of PICALM expression are often based on the bulk tissue\n                             of human postmortem brains [32,33,124]. Since the cell type composition of brain tissue\n                          undergoes alterations during the progression of neurodegenerative disease, such bulk data\n                    may confound the interpretation of differences in gene expression between AD patients\n                       and controls.\n                                 In general, there is a widespread heterogeneity between mRNA and protein levels in\n                         postmortem human control and AD brains, including PICALM [124]. For instance, increased\n                     PICALM transcripts [32] and decreased PICALM protein level [33,34] was observed in AD\n                              brains. Due to such an obvious contradiction of PICALM mRNA and protein levels in\n                      AD, mRNA data cannot be simply used to predict the protein expression of PICALM. The\n                              ﬁrst possible hypothesis of such divergence is a cellular autoregulatory mechanism with\n                          a negative feedback loop [160]. The second possible hypothesis is microRNA (miRNA)-\n                              related gene expression regulations. Post-transcriptional repression of mRNA by miRNA\n                          has been well-studied in mammalian cells [161]. Studies suggest an important regulatory\n                                role of miR-155 in neuroinﬂammatory conditions, including AD [162]. Interestingly, several\n                         independent studies suggest the upregulation of miR-155 in various brain regions of AD\n                              patients compared to controls as well as in the brain of transgenic mouse models of Aβ and\n                            tau pathologies [163,164]. Indeed, it has been shown that PICALM is regulated by miR-155\n                              in mouse brains [165]. Although there is no obvious effect of miRNA-155 knockout on the\n                            expression level of PICALM transcripts in the mouse brains of these models [166], the effect\n                               of miRNA-155 overexpression on PICALM (transcript and protein) expression in human AD\n                             brains remains elusive. While further study is necessary to better understand the potential\n                            regulatory mechanisms of PICALM expression, miR-155 may provide a key pathway to\n                           untangle the divergence of mRNA and protein levels of PICALM. It would be intriguing to\n                     ﬁnd correlation between the PICALM level and miR-155 in further studies. In addition,\n                              post-transcriptional regulatory effects of other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding\n                 RNA and circular RNA on PICALM, need to be investigated in AD models. The last but\n                            not least hypothesis to explain the divergence of mRNA and protein levels is that PICALM\n                    may undergo abnormally accelerated proteolysis in AD brains.

Several independent studies have reported that the depletion of PICALM\n                            leads to an increase in the size of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and to an increase in\n                            heterogeneity in the CCVs shape in cultured cells of rat hippocampus [46] and of HeLa\n                                  cells [43,47]. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PICALM disruption also leads to an increase in the\n                       number of early endosomes in HeLa cells [48]. A similar observation was obtained by the\n                            depletion of uncoordinated protein-11 (unc-11), the ortholog of PICALM in neurons of C.\n                               elegans [49]. Another study suggests that PICALM is required for efﬁcient clathrin coat\n                           maturation in ﬁbroblasts [50].\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Figure 2. PICALM regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and autophagy. (A) PICALM is involved\n                                  in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) as a clathrin adaptor by facilitating the formation of clathrin-\n                              coated vesicles (CCVs). The interaction between PICALM, adaptor proteins (AP) and clathrin is\n                                      critical to maintaining the form and sizes of CCVs. PICALM interacts with AP2 at the plasma\n                        membrane and AP 1 in the trans-Golgi network to form CCVs. (B) PICALM is also involved in\n                               multiple steps of autophagy process. PICALM is involved in the autophagy precursor formation at\n                                the autophagosome-lysosome fusion [51], maturation of Cathepsin D and lysosomal function [48].\n\n                                   2.1.2. PICALM, Hematopoiesis, Transferrin-Uptake and Cholesterol Homeostasis\n\n                          Chromosomal translocations of PICALM have been observed in patients with acute\n                           lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia [52]. In mice, nonsense point muta-\n                               tions of PICALM cause abnormal iron distribution, growth retardation, shortened life span\n                       and hematopoietic abnormalities [53].\n                       PICALM is a critical protein, and homozygous PICALM knockout mice are dwarfed\n                       and die within 1 month after birth due to a deﬁciency in erythroid maturation and trans-\n                               ferrin uptake [54]. There are controversies in the literature on the effects of PICALM on\n                              transferrin uptake. While some studies suggest that PICALM overexpression or down-\n                           expression did not alter transferrin uptake in HeLa cells or HEK293 cells [55,56], others\n                          observed a signiﬁcant effect on transferrin uptake in the liver, bone marrow and erythroid\n                                   cells from PICALM-deﬁcient mice [50,54]. It is thus speculated that the deletion of PICALM\n                     may be partially compensated by other endocytic proteins in certain types of cells. Indeed,\n                    PICALM is dispensable in myeloid and B-lymphoid development [50].\n                                  Additionally, PICALM also modulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis, as PICALM\n                           expression inﬂuences the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol\n                            biosynthesis and lipoprotein uptake [57].

Numerous studies have suggested that both synthetic and AD brain-\n                           derived tau ﬁbrils can propagate in a prion-like manner by recruiting normal unfolded tau\n                              into pathological tau aggregates [11]. Tau aggregation can also be found in neurons and\n                                glia of other human neurological disorders, so-called tauopathies, such as frontotemporal\n                             lobar degeneration (FTLD) with tau pathology, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Pick\n                              disease, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), etc. [12].\n                    AD can be generally classiﬁed into two subgroups according to the age of onset. AD\n                            cases occurring earlier than age 65 are termed early-onset AD (EOAD), constituting less\n                           than 5% of all cases. Early-onset AD includes familial AD (FAD) inherited in an autosomal-\n                         dominant manner and can present at a very early age of onset and with a more rapid rate of\n                             disease progression, constituting 1–2% of AD cases. A number of FAD mutations have been\n                           identiﬁed in the genes of APP, Presenilin1 (PSEN1) and Presenilin2 (PSEN2) (γ-secretase\n                         component) [13].\n                                  Since age is the most important risk factor for AD [14], the great majority of cases, esti-\n                        mated at more than 95%, occur after age 65, constituting late-onset AD (LOAD). There was\n                                        little knowledge of genetic risk factors for LOAD except for Apolipoprotein (APOE) risk allele\n                     APOE4 till the breakthrough made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [15,16]. To\n                              date, GWAS have identiﬁed about 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including\n                       APOE4, BIN1, PICALM, CLU, CR1, ABCA7, TREM2, MS4A and APH1B, with a signiﬁcant\n                              association for LOAD susceptibility [17]. These LOAD-susceptibility genes are functionally\n                           implicated in multiple cellular processes such as synaptic function, lipid metabolism, in-\n                        ﬂammation, endocytosis, cytoskeletal transports, and tau and amyloid pathways in AD\n                             pathologies [18–20]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the GWAS hit genes modulate\n                            the AD risk remain largely elusive and have been under active scrutiny in the ﬁeld of\n                             functional genomics in the post GWAS era. The vast majority of these variants are located\n                              in the noncoding region [21], and such variants are supposed to exert phenotypic effects\n                             via the perturbation of transcriptional gene promoters and enhancers [22].\n                       Among them, several independent GWAS have identiﬁed SNPs signiﬁcantly associ-\n                            ated with LOAD in the PICALM gene (see Section 3.1) coding phosphatidylinositol binding\n                             clathrin-assembly protein PICALM (also known as CALM that stands for clathrin assembly\n                        lymphoid myeloid leukemia). Numerous GWAS have suggested that PICALM is one of\n                             the most signiﬁcant susceptibility genes for LOAD after APOE4 and BIN1 [15,17,19,23–27].\n                             Since the discovery of the genetic implication of PICALM in LOAD, many studies have been\n                          conducted to decipher the roles of PICALM in AD pathogenesis. In light of these ﬁndings,\n                    we describe in this review the protein structure and known post-translational modiﬁcations\n                              of PICALM. We summarize the emerging link between PICALM and pathogenic proteins\n                         found in AD brains to better understand the mechanisms by which PICALM contributes to\n                 AD pathogenesis via Aβ-dependent and Aβ-independent pathways.\n\n                                   2. Biology of PICALM\n                                   2.1. Tissue Expression, Cellular Functions and Protein Interaction of PICALM\n\n                           The human PICALM gene is located on chromosome 11 [28]. There are 24 transcripts\n                            as splice variants, 15 of them coding protein [28], whose sizes vary from 134 to 652 amino\n                              acids [29], and the molecular weights of the major isoforms are estimated at 65–75 kDa due\n                              to alternative splicing of exon 13 [30]. PICALM is a ubiquitous protein and is expressed\n                              in the brain, muscle, kidney, urinary bladder, connective tissues, bone marrow, lymphoid\n                              tissues and in female tissues, including breast and placenta, https://www.proteinatlas.\n                        org/ENSG00000073921-PICALM/tissue (accessed on 1 June 2022). [31]. In the humanCells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                             3 of 26\n\n\n\n                              brain, PICALM is abundantly expressed in the microglia, oligodendrocytes, endothelial\n                                   cells, neurons, vascular mural and choroid plexus cells (for further information on the\n                               localization of PICALM in the AD brain, see 3.3.1) [30,32–36]. In the mouse brain, PICALM\n                mRNA is highly expressed in the hippocampus [31], in particular in the dentate gyrus\n                           granule cells, as detected by a spatial transcriptomic study [37,38].\n                        STRING database analysis revealed predicted protein–protein interactions of PI-\n                 CALM [39,40]. PICALM interacts with key proteins for clathrin-mediated endocytosis,\n                               intracellular trafﬁcking and signaling (Figure 1). Interestingly, PICALM tightly interacts\n                          with other proteins encoded by GWAS hit genes for LOAD, such as BIN1, CD2AP, EPHA1,\n                     AP2A1 and AP2A2 [41]. PICALM is almost perfectly colocalized with the AP2 adaptor\n                       and AP2 α-adaptin subunits (encoded by AP2A1 and AP2A2) [42,43]. Interestingly, gene\n                               variants, splicing defects and altered expression of AP2A1 and AP2A2 have been recently\n                      shown to have a signiﬁcant association with LOAD susceptibility [41]. Mounting evidence\n                           suggests PICALM has multiple roles in cellular functions and homeostasis as a clathrin\n                   "

PICALM plays critical role related to\n                              both tau and Aβ pathologies, such as cholesterol dyshomeostasis, inﬂammation, iron dyshomeostasis\n                         and autophagy (yellow). PICALM is also crucial for neuronal toxicity via glial lipid transport,\n                               synaptic functions, glutaminergic transmission and modifying Aβ-toxicity (blue).Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            19 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   5. Conclusions\n\n                               Multiple lines of evidence suggest that human PICALM polymorphism modulates\n                 AD pathogenesis. PICALM is involved not only in Aβ production and clearance but also\n                              in tau-mediated neurodegeneration and in endocytic homeostasis. The exact role of the\n                       polymorphism on PICALM expression may vary in different cell types and contribute\n                              to multiple pathways in AD pathological mechanisms. Further studies are necessary\n                              to decipher the AD-speciﬁc post-translational modiﬁcations and the functional roles of\n                         LOAD-related susceptibility alleles to provide mechanistic insights into the pathological\n                            dysregulation of PICALM.\n\n\n                           Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:\n                              //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells11243994/s1, Table S1: Summary statistics for SNPs reaching\n                           genome-wide signiﬁcance.

SORL1-deficient mice have elevated Aβ levels (139). SORL1\n                  mRNA expression is reduced in AD brains (140 142).

Thus, the role of SORL1 in controlling APP cleavage and\n                    APOE uptake may be critical to maintaining signaling functions in the brain.Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Biol Psychiatry.

PLD3 is located at chromosomeNIH-PA\n                            19q13.2 and is alternatively spliced into 25 predicted transcripts. Whole exome sequencing\n                                  in LOAD families was coupled with genotyping in large case-control series to identifyAuthor                   PLD3 V232M as an AD risk factor (11).\n\n                                 Classical PLD proteins catalyze the hydrolysis of phophatidylcholine to generate\n                               phosphatidic acid, which acts as an effector for clathrin mediated endocytosis (144) and\n                            have been implicated in AD pathogenesis (145-148). PLD3 is highly expressed in neurons inManuscript                            the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and frontal cortex. In vitro, co-expression of PLD3 with\n                      APP produces significantly lower extracellular Aβ levels by a mechanism that remains\n                         unknown (11).\n\n          New LOAD Risk Genes\n                               Additional loci were identified in the largest LOAD GWAS to-date: CASS4, CELF1, DSG2,\n                       FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3,\n                    ZCWPW1 (6). Much less is known of the role of these genes in AD; however, many of theseNIH-PA                             genes fit into known pathways that are altered in AD. HLA-DRB5-DRB1 and INPP5D are\n                              involved in the immune response. MEF2C is involved in the immune response and in\n                                synaptic function. PTK2B is involved in cell migration and synaptic function. CELF1,Author\n                       NME8, and CASS4 are involved in cytoskeletal function and axonal transport. CASS4 is\n                               implicated in APP and tau metabolism. FERMT2 is also implicated in tau metabolism (6).\n                                Importantly, several of these susceptibility loci occur in gene-dense regions; so, it remains\n                               unclear which gene is responsible for the association.Manuscript\n           Conclusions\n\n                         The identification of common and rare variants that contribute to AD risk has provided new\n                                opportunities to understand the mechanisms underlying AD. The majority of the genes\n                                 recently identified affect Aβ production and clearance, highlighting the importance of this\n                           pathway in AD pathogenesis. As whole genome and exome sequencing studies in large\n                                 datasets are completed, it is very likely that many more genes will be added to this list.
