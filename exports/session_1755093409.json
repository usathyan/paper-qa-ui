  "question": "provide a detailed analysis of PICALM activity in Alzheimers",
  "answer": "PICALM (phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin-assembly protein) plays a multifaceted role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis, influencing amyloid-beta (Aβ) production and clearance, tau pathology, and cellular homeostasis (Ando2022 pages 18-19).\n\n**Genetic Associations and Expression:**\n*   Specific PICALM variants, such as rs10792832 and rs3851179, are associated with an increased risk of AD (Ando2022 pages 10-10).\n*   The non-protective variant rs10792832 is linked to reduced chromatin accessibility and gene expression in microglia (Ando2022 pages 10-10).\n*   Conversely, the protective rs3851179T allele is associated with increased PICALM expression in the brain, particularly in endothelial cells and induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into endothelium (Ando2022 pages 10-10).\n*   The non-protective rs3851179C allele is linked to reduced PICALM isoform 2 mRNA expression in the frontal and temporal cortex (Ando2022 pages 10-10).\n*   While PICALM mRNA levels are upregulated in AD brains and blood, total protein levels tend to decrease, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation (Ando2022 pages 16-17, Ando2022 pages 13-14).\n*   PICALM expression is dysregulated in a cell-type-specific manner in AD brains, with upregulation in microglia and neurons, and downregulation in endothelial cells (Ando2022 pages 13-14, Ando2022 pages 17-18).\n\n**Role in Aβ Pathology:**\n*   PICALM is involved in APP processing, potentially reducing Aβ production by facilitating the transport of APP-CTFs into autophagosomes for degradation (Ando2022 pages 12-12).\n*   It regulates APP processing through γ-secretase internalization by interacting with Nicastrin and modulates BACE1 expression (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n*   PICALM participates in the clathrin-dependent internalization of Aβ bound to LRP1, aiding in Aβ transcytosis and clearance (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n*   However, studies on the impact of reduced PICALM expression in AD models have yielded contradictory results regarding amyloid load, suggesting context-dependent effects (Ando2022 pages 12-13).\n*   PICALM may contribute to Aβ-induced toxicity through intermediaries like N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (Ando2022 pages 13-14).\n\n**Role in Tau Pathology:**\n*   PICALM levels correlate with phosphotau and autophagy-related proteins and are associated with tau inclusions in AD (Ando2022 pages 24-25).\n*   PICALM haploinsufficiency exacerbates tau pathology in a transgenic mouse model, indicating a deficit in the autophagy pathway when PICALM levels are reduced in the presence of tau pathology (Ando2022 pages 15-16, Ando2022 pages 24-25).\n*   Given that tau pathology spreads partly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), PICALM, as a clathrin adaptor, may be involved in tau internalization (Ando2022 pages 15-16).\n*   PICALM binds to LRP1, which is implicated in regulating tau seeding and internalization, and PICALM's modulation of LRP1 internalization could influence pathological tau spreading (Ando2022 pages 15-16).\n*   PICALM also affects cholesterol homeostasis, and cholesterol depletion can promote tau uptake and aggregation, potentially linking PICALM-mediated cholesterol misregulation to tau pathology progression (Ando2022 pages 15-16).\n*   PICALM co-immunoprecipitates with hyperphosphorylated tau, suggesting a potential role in tau pathology, possibly mediated by ubiquitin binding (Ando2022 pages 13-14).\n\n**Cellular Functions and Homeostasis:**\n*   PICALM is crucial for neuronal function, influencing neuronal polarity, neuritic growth, and synaptic vesicle sorting (Ando2022 pages 5-5).\n*   It is involved in endocytosis and regulates membrane fusion by binding to R-SNAREs (Ando2022 pages 5-5).\n*   PICALM modulates the surface levels of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, impacting synaptic plasticity, learning, LTP, and LTD (Ando2022 pages 5-5).\n*   PICALM plays a role in autophagy, regulating autophagosome maturation and fusion (Ando2022 pages 5-5).\n*   It is implicated in cholesterol and iron homeostasis, both of which are dysregulated in AD (Ando2022 pages 18-19, Ando2022 pages 15-16).\n*   PICALM rescues endocytic defects caused by the Apoe4 allele (Ando2022 pages 25-26).\n*   PICALM knockdown leads to reduced lipid droplet formation and impaired fatty acid uptake in glial cells, affecting neuroprotective lipid transport (Ando2022 pages 16-17).\n\n**Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs):**\n*   PICALM undergoes various PTMs, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and sumoylation, which can influence its interactions and functions (Ando2022 pages 7-8, Ando2022 pages 5-7).\n*   Aβ exposure increases PICALM phosphorylation, but the specific sites, kinases, and whether this dysregulation impacts PICALM's stability or function in AD remain unclear (Ando2022 pages 7-8).\n*   PICALM is a substrate of calpain and caspase, enzymes activated in AD brains, suggesting potential accelerated proteolysis (Ando2022 pages 17-18).\n\nIn summary, PICALM is a key player in AD pathogenesis, with genetic variants influencing disease risk and its expression levels varying across cell types in AD brains. Its functions in APP processing, Aβ clearance, tau pathology, and cellular homeostasis highlight its complex and significant role in the disease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the precise mechanisms by which PICALM contributes to AD and how its PTMs are affected in the disease state (Ando2022 pages 18-19, Ando2022 pages 7-8, Ando2022 pages 17-18).",

Certain\n                              factors are known to induce some of the post-translational modifications on PICALM,\n                         such as phosphorylation by Aβ treatment in primary neuronal culture [75], by BI2536, a\n                               selective inhibitor of protein kinase Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1), inducing phosphorylation\n                           (Y138, T146 and S537) [76], by ischemia (S303 and S315) [77] and by nocodazole, an in-\n                               hibitor of microtubule polymerization (S474 and S645) [78]. The most well-characterized\n                  PTM of PICALM are the four phosphorylation sites (S16, Y96, S107 and S303) and two\n                            ubiquitination sites (K318 and K324) that have been validated by mass-spectrometry\n                      and have been described for more than 5 times [65]. While the phosphorylation on\n                           the ANTH domain may influence the interactions of PICALM with PtdIns(4,5)P2 or\n                    R-SNARE proteins, the other phosphorylation residues are located in the C-terminal\n                             clathrin adaptor domain exhibiting pivotal functions in protein–protein interaction of\n                   PICALM with clathrin and other endocytic machinery proteins. Therefore, it is specu-\n                             lated that phosphorylation of PICALM should play a role in regulating interaction with\n                            PtdIns(4,5)P2 and other protein binding partners. For instance, the R-SNARE binding\n                       domain contains several sites that can undergo PTM, such as one phosphorylation (Y237),\n                       two ubiquitination (K231 and K252) and one sumoylation (K238), and thus, these PTM\n                    may regulate the interaction between PICALM and R-SNARE.\n                       PICALM is a substrate of calpain and caspase [33,79,80]. Nevertheless, it remains\n                              largely unknown if the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of PICALM affect its protein\n                                 stability or degradation.\n                           Given that PICALM contains more than 130 putative phosphorylation sites, PI-\n                 CALM phosphorylation may be dysregulated in AD brains not only in terms of its\n                           global phosphorylation level but also in the pattern of site-specific phosphorylation.\n                          Indeed, Aβ exposure increases PICALM phosphorylation in primary rat neuronal cor-\n                                  tical culture [75] though phosphorylation sites and the involved kinases remain to be\n                              identified. While it is speculated that phosphorylation may change the interaction\n                             of PICALM with its binding partners such as R-SNAREs, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or clathrin,\n                                        it remains elusive which kinases are involved in PICALM phosphorylation, whether\n                   PICALM phosphorylation is misregulated during the progression of AD, whether PI-\n                 CALM phosphorylation has any impact on its protein stability/degradation or its\n                            subcellular localization and whether phosphorylation of PICALM may cause a loss of\n                           function and/or a gain of toxicity.\n\n                                   3.

Gene Location and Genetic Variants of PICALM\n\n                                 In humans, the PICALM gene is located on chromosome 11q14 (Figure 4). Since\n                             several independent GWAS have reported the involvement of PICALM SNPs in LOAD\n                                 susceptibility, many other studies have replicated and conﬁrmed the association of PICALM\n                             genetic variants with LOAD in diverse cohorts (see review [44]). There have been several\n                         LOAD-associated SNPs identiﬁed within or near the PICALM gene so far (Table S1). A\n                             recent large GWAS (n = 788,989) suggests that the most signiﬁcant SNP associated with\n                  LOAD susceptibility is rs3851179, located in the intergenic regions between PICALM and\n                    EED [17].Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                             8 of 26\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Figure 4.

Glutaminergic neurons are the most vulnerable subtype of neurons in\n                      AD, and soluble Aβ enhances glutamate release, leading to excessive activation [120,121].\n                           Whilst NMDAR is critical for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, excessive NMDAR\n                             activation leads to excitotoxicity and cell death [122]. A recent study in the drosophila\n                        model of AD has suggested that overexpression of LAP, the drosophila PICALM orthologue,\n                            rescues Aβ42-induced toxicity without affecting Aβ42 level [117].\n\n                                   3.3. PICALM and Tau\n                                   3.3.1. PICALM Expression and Localization in AD Brains\n\n                                   Different lines of evidence suggest that PICALM expression is dysregulated during the\n                            progression of AD. Under a physiological condition in the central nervous system (CNS),\n                    PICALM is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types such as endothelial, neuronal andCells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            14 of 26\n\n\n\n                              microglial cells [30,32–36,123]. In AD postmortem brains, however, PICALM may undergo\n                        an alteration of expression levels and protein localizations in distinct cell types.\n                            During the progression of AD, PICALM mRNA expression levels are increased in\n                            the brain [32,124] and in the blood [125] of AD patients. In contrast, the PICALM protein\n                               level in the total bulk tissue is decreased in AD brains [33]. Another study has shown\n                              that PICALM protein level is decreased in the isolated microvessel fraction of AD brains\n                          but is not signiﬁcantly altered in the microvessel-depleted fraction of AD brains [34]. In\n                               line with this discordant observation, Tasaki et al., have recently reported that there is a\n                           general divergence between the levels of transcripts (mRNA) and protein expression in\n                        postmortem AD brain tissue. By mass-spectrometry, they observed a signiﬁcant reduction\n                              of PICALM protein in a correlation with 14.3% faster cognitive decline [124].\n                           Most of the analyses made on PICALM expression were conducted using human\n                        postmortem tissues of the affected brain regions that contain different cell types. Single-\n                                  cell transcriptomic studies have shown that groups of GWAS hit genes, including PI-\n                    CALM, are generally upregulated in microglial cells in correlation with neuronal AD\n                          pathology [126]. While PICALM immunoreactivity in microglial cells is increased in\n                 LOAD brains [33], PICALM immunolabelling is decreased in endothelial cells [30], and\n                   PICALM protein level assessed by Western blot is decreased in the microvessel fraction\n                             of postmortem AD brain tissues [34]. Neuronal PICALM labeling is increased in AD\n                            brains [33,34] and is associated with NFTs (Figure 6A–C) [33]. PICALM and hyperphos-\n                          phorylated tau are co-immunoprecipitated in AD brain lysate [33]. Since pathological\n                           tau in NFTs is ubiquitinated [127], and the ANTH domain of PICALM has an afﬁnity to\n                            ubiquitin [67], the interaction between PICALM and tau needs to be further analyzed in\n                           non-pathological and pathological conditions to determine the role of ubiquitin to form\n                      tau–PICALM complex. Other studies have shown immunoreactivities of PICALM inter-\n                              actors such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 [123,128] and AP2A1 [129] in association with ph"

PICALM and APP Processing\n                            Given that the generation of Aβ peptides from APP and its accumulation are pivotal\n                          events in AD pathogenesis, researchers have sought to identify the role of PICALM\n                       on Aβ pathology.  Multiple lines of evidence suggest that PICALM regulates APP\n                            processing [35,113–115] and Aβ transcytosis [34].\n                               Tian et al., have reported a rather protective role of PICALM in APP metabolism.\n                    PICALM forms a complex with APP-CTF together with AP2 and microtubule-associated\n                            protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagy marker [115]. The interaction of APP-CTFs,\n                      PICALM, AP2 and LC3 results in transporting APP-CTFs into the autophagosome in which\n                       APP-CTFs are degraded by autophagy. The interaction between APP-CTFs and PICALM\n                          consequently leads to a reduction of Aβ production [114].

Although there is no obvious effect of miRNA-155 knockout on the\n                            expression level of PICALM transcripts in the mouse brains of these models [166], the effect\n                               of miRNA-155 overexpression on PICALM (transcript and protein) expression in human AD\n                             brains remains elusive. While further study is necessary to better understand the potential\n                            regulatory mechanisms of PICALM expression, miR-155 may provide a key pathway to\n                           untangle the divergence of mRNA and protein levels of PICALM. It would be intriguing to\n                     ﬁnd correlation between the PICALM level and miR-155 in further studies. In addition,\n                              post-transcriptional regulatory effects of other non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding\n                 RNA and circular RNA on PICALM, need to be investigated in AD models. The last but\n                            not least hypothesis to explain the divergence of mRNA and protein levels is that PICALM\n                    may undergo abnormally accelerated proteolysis in AD brains. Several lines of evidence\n                            suggest that PICALM is cleaved by both calpain and caspase [33,79,80], which are activated\n                              in AD brains [138]. Moreover, post-translational modiﬁcations of PICALM might affect its\n                            degradation, stabilization, protein–protein interaction or subcellular localization, yet such\n                                 effects remain largely elusive. Further studies are thus necessary to decipher the potential\n                            abnormalities of PICALM post-translational modiﬁcations using 2D Western blot analyses\n                       and mass spectrometry from control and AD brain samples to search for AD-speciﬁc\n                              post-translational modiﬁcations of PICALM and their implications in pathology.\n\n                                   4.2. Challenges in Deciphering the Effect of PICALM Variants on Its Expression\n\n                                Several independent studies have recently reported a signiﬁcant association of the\n                           LOAD-susceptibility PICALM risk variants (rs10792832 and rs3851179 that are in full LD)\n                       on the decreased expression in microglial cells [90,91]. It should be highly informative\n                              to create AD models in which microglial PICALM expression is modulated in order to\n                           unravel the effect of reduced or increased PICALM expression in microglia.\n                                 Additionally, in iPSC-derived endothelial cells, the protective rs3851179T allele is\n                              associated with increased mRNA and protein expression of PICALM [34] and in bulk tissues\n                     when analyzed relative to cell-speciﬁc mRNA markers for microvessels and neurons [30].\n                        Given that the effect of rs3851179T is rather modest when normalized to astrocyte marker\n                    GFAP (glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein), it becomes more remarkable when normalized to\n                            endothelial cell markers or neuronal markers [30]. Therefore, it is possible that PICALM\n                             variants may have distinct effects on its expression in different cell types.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            18 of 26\n\n\n\n                            To decipher the inconsistencies in mRNA and protein levels of PICALM observed\n                              in postmortem human AD brain samples [124], the PICALM levels in each cell type\n                                    (e.g., microglia, neuron, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, etc.) should be analyzed in large\n                              scale diverse cohorts by high throughput single cell sequencing and further validated by\n                         RT-qPCR, Western blotting, mass-spectrometry (in distinct cell-type fractions) and by in situ\n                             hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry (in sections) of postmortem human AD brain\n                         samples [167]. As shown by Zhao et al., on the functional effect of rs3851179 on PICALM\n                            expression in iPSC-derived endothelial cells, it should be interesting to differentiate iPSC\n                              isogenic for rs3851179T/C into various cell types to examine the expression level of PICALM\n                              in distinct cell types. More work is necessary to increase the number of samples from\n                                different cohorts to improve the power of statistical analyses and pursue proteomic analyses\n                            "

Since MAPT gene mutations are not linked to AD, further\n                             studies are required to decipher the role of PICALM in the development and propagation\n                              of non-mutant tau.\n\n                                   3.3.4. PICALM and Tau Pathology Propagation\n\n                                  In AD brains, tau pathology develops in a stereotypical manner across neuroanatomi-\n                                cally connected networks [142]. Given that tau pathology propagates, at least partially, via\n                            clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [143], a clathrin adaptor such as PICALM may be\n                           involved in clathrin-mediated tau internalization.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            16 of 26\n\n\n\n                                  In addition to the prominent role of LRP1 in Aβ clearance [144], recent studies suggest\n                            the involvement of LRP1 in regulating tau seeding and internalization [145]. LRP1 is\n                           expressed in neuronal, glial and endothelial cells [146]. The afﬁnity of the tau microtubule-\n                          binding domain to LRP1 is high under physiological conditions, while hyperphospho-\n                              rylation of tau leads to a reduction of its binding afﬁnity to LRP1 [147]. Therefore, their\n                               interaction may be weaker in AD brains. Since PICALM directly binds to LRP1 to regulate\n                             the internalization of LRP1 [34], it can be speculated that PICALM modulates pathological\n                            tau spreading via LRP1-mediated pathological tau internalization.\n                        PICALM also modulates cholesterol biogenesis and lipoprotein uptake (see Section 2.1.2).\n                              Cholesterol is implicated in amyloid pathology [148] and is detected in amyloid plaques [149].\n                             Since cholesterol depletion promotes tau uptake and aggregation [150], PICALM-mediated\n                           misregulation of cholesterol homeostasis may be related to both amyloid and tau pathol-\n                        ogy progression.\n                       PICALM is involved in iron uptake via transferrin (see Section 2.1.2). Iron in Fe3+\n                              (redox-inert state) is detected in NFTs of AD [151] and is implicated in tangle formation [152]\n                       and in APP processing [153]. Given PICALM is misregulated in AD brains, the PICALM-\n                         mediated iron uptake may be involved in AD pathogenesis.\n                   A study using the HEK tau biosensor cell model [154] has suggested no effect of\n                             deletion of GWAS hit genes, including PICALM, on the FRET-based signal of tau-tau\n                              interaction [155]. Since a lipofectamine-based method was used for PHF internalization,\n                         Kolay et al., focused on the effect of a GWAS hit gene depletion on FRET-based tau-tau\n                              interaction but not on the effect on the “physiological” uptake of PHF. It remains elusive\n                                          if PICALM overexpression modulates PHF uptake or tau-tau interaction. Further studies\n                             are necessary to assess the role of PICALM in modulating the prion-like tau pathology\n                           propagation in in vitro and in vivo models.\n\n                                   3.4.

Indeed, single cell transcriptome from postmortem AD brains suggests\n                              that a group of genes, including PICALM, APOE, TREM2, MEF2C and the MHC class II\n                          genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5 are upregulated in microglial cells in correlation with\n                 AD pathology [126].\n                        APOE4 carriers exhibit endocytic defects before signiﬁcant amyloid deposition [157].\n                    PICALM is described as a modiﬁer of APOE4-induced endocytic defects in human iPSC-\n                           derived astrocytes and in yeast. PICALM and its yeast orthologue YAP1802 overexpression\n                           rescued APOE4-induced endosomal abnormalities in human iPSC-derived astrocytes and\n                              yeast, respectively [158]. Nonetheless, PICALM immunoreactivity is hardly detected in\n                              astrocytes in postmortem human brain tissues [33], and thus, the implication of PICALM in\n                               astrocytic endocytosis might be an adjunct contributor to AD pathogenesis.\n                              Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce neuronal lipid synthesis\n                             that leads to the sequestration of glial lipid droplets (LD) to delay neurotoxicity [159].\n                   PICALM modulates this neuroprotective process of neuron-to-glia lipid transport.\n                    PICALM orthologue LAP knockdown in drosophila glia leads to a significantly reduced\n                   LD formation. PICALM knockdown in rat astrocytes leads to reduced uptake of neuron-\n                         derived fatty acids [159]. PICALM and other proteins encoded by LOAD GWAS hits\n                      (APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, AP2A2 and RIN3) are thus involved in LD formation and/or\n                           neuron-glial lipid transfer pathway, and knockdown of PICALM leads to blunted\n                              lipid transfer.Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            17 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   4. Discussion\n                                   4.1. Difﬁculties in Interpreting Expression Levels of PICALM in AD Brains\n\n                              Cautions need to be taken to interpret the data about PICALM expression in human\n                         autopsy tissues. The results of PICALM expression are often based on the bulk tissue\n                             of human postmortem brains [32,33,124]. Since the cell type composition of brain tissue\n                          undergoes alterations during the progression of neurodegenerative disease, such bulk data\n                    may confound the interpretation of differences in gene expression between AD patients\n                       and controls.\n                                 In general, there is a widespread heterogeneity between mRNA and protein levels in\n                         postmortem human control and AD brains, including PICALM [124]. For instance, increased\n                     PICALM transcripts [32] and decreased PICALM protein level [33,34] was observed in AD\n                              brains. Due to such an obvious contradiction of PICALM mRNA and protein levels in\n                      AD, mRNA data cannot be simply used to predict the protein expression of PICALM. The\n                              ﬁrst possible hypothesis of such divergence is a cellular autoregulatory mechanism with\n                          a negative feedback loop [160]. The second possible hypothesis is microRNA (miRNA)-\n                              related gene expression regulations. Post-transcriptional repression of mRNA by miRNA\n                          has been well-studied in mammalian cells [161]. Studies suggest an important regulatory\n                                role of miR-155 in neuroinﬂammatory conditions, including AD [162]. Interestingly, several\n                         independent studies suggest the upregulation of miR-155 in various brain regions of AD\n                              patients compared to controls as well as in the brain of transgenic mouse models of Aβ and\n                            tau pathologies [163,164]. Indeed, it has been shown that PICALM is regulated by miR-155\n                              in mouse brains [165]. Although there is no obvious effect of miRNA-155 knockout on the\n                            expression level of PICALM transcripts in the mouse brains of these models [166], the ef"

PICALM and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)\n\n                              Analyses on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) suggest that there may be a\n                               cell-type speciﬁc effect of the PICALM variant, notably in microglia. Several recent PI-\n                  CALM eQTL analyses have consistently suggested that there is a signiﬁcant colocalization\n                         between AD GWAS signals and PICALM eQTL in microglia [90–93]. PICALM rs10792832\n                                (in almost full LD with rs3851179) is located in an open chromatin region (OCR), and the\n                             non-protective variant was associated with both lower OCR signal and gene expression by\n                             regulating chromatin accessibility [91].\n                                Microglia may not be the only cell type affected by PICALM variants. The protective\n                           rs3851179T allele is linked to increased PICALM expression in the brain [81,94], especially\n                           implicated in PICALM expression in endothelial cells [30,34]. The rs3851179T allele is\n                            associated with increased PICALM mRNA and protein expression in induced pluripo-\n                              tent stem cells (iPSC) differentiated into endothelium compared to isogenic cells bearing\n                            non-protective rs3851179C [34]. The non-protective rs3851179C allele is associated with a\n                             signiﬁcant reduction in PICALM isoform 2 mRNA expression in the frontal and in temporal\n                             cortex [94].\n                                 Alternative splicing of PICALM is signiﬁcantly changed in AD brains in relation to\n                            LOAD-susceptibility variants [41]. Differential excision of introns in the PICALM gene was\n                         observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of AD brains in correlation with\n                            the GWAS signal [41]. Raj and colleagues observed such alteration of alternative splicing\n                              in iPSC-derived neurons overexpressing tau, suggesting that accumulation of tau drives\n                         abnormal alternative splicing of key AD genes, including PICALM.\n                                               It has to be noted that the nearest coding gene of rs3851179 is EED [17]. A colocalization\n                             of the EED function association has been reported [95]. It remains elusive if EED is also\n                           involved in AD pathogenesis.\n                             These data support the hypothesis that PICALM is the risk gene in the locus and\n                              that the potential effect for AD risk is, at least partially, via modulation of microglial\n                     PICALM expression.\n\n                                   3.1.3.

This critical role of PICALM\n                              in autophagy is strengthened by another study showing that loss of exon 1 of PICALM\n                              in HeLa cells leads to an augmentation of lysosomal enzymes in the endosome-enriched\n                               fraction and accumulation of autophagy substrates such as APP-CTFs [48].\n                       PICALM regulates APP processing via γ-secretase internalization due to a direct\n                              interaction between the PICALM ANTH domain and Nicastrin, one of the components of\n                             the γ-secretase complex [116]. Intriguingly, PICALM itself modulates APP-CTF production\n                             via controlling BACE1 expression [94].Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            13 of 26\n\n\n\n                                 In addition, PICALM has been reported to be a regulator of PICALM/clathrin-\n                        dependent internalization of Aβ bound to the low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related\n                             protein-1 (LRP1), a major Aβ receptor, leading to Aβ transcytosis and clearance [34].\n                         As there are multiple implications of PICALM in the regulation of Aβ pathology\n                           (autophagy, APP processing, transcytosis), it is not surprising that there are some contra-\n                             dictory observations in transgenic models of amyloid pathology with reduced expression\n                             of PICALM. One study has shown a signiﬁcant increase in amyloid load in PICALM+/−\n                           crossed with APPsw/0 and observed a 3.5-4-fold increase in Aβ load in the 9-month-old\n                     APPsw/0PICALM+/−mouse brain [34]. On the other hand, Kanatsu et al., observed a\n                             signiﬁcant reduction of Aβ load in 12-month-old A7/PICALM+/−mouse brains. Further,\n                          Xiao et al., have reported that PICALM is colocalized with APP and PICALM expression\n                                level has a signiﬁcant impact on Aβ level in APP/PS1 mice injected with adeno-associated\n                            virus (AAV)-mediated modulation of PICALM levels. While PICALM overexpression\n                              increases APP internalization and Aβ production, PICALM knockdown decreases amyloid\n                           load [35]. Furthermore, drosophila PICALM orthologue LAP overexpression did not alter\n                            the Aβ42 level in a drosophila model overexpressing Aβ42 [117]. The discrepancy of the\n                            observation on Aβ production may be related to the different transgenes with distinct mu-\n                               tations and the differences in amyloid doses in the models analyzed. These contradictory\n                           data imply that the effect of PICALM reduction can differ depending on the progression\n                             of Aβ pathology.

These inconsistent observations are\n                              partly due to the heterogeneity of the Aβ species and the distinct expression level of Aβ.

PICALM and other\n                           endocytic proteins encoded by AD susceptibility genes may be implicated in such steps\n                              that lead to dysfunction and breakdown of ﬁnely tuned cellular physiological functions.\n                    PICALM may be a small piece of complex endocytic machinery that may be vulnerable to\n                           neurodegeneration [169].\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Figure 7. Effects of PICALM on AD pathogenesis pathways and neurodegeneration. PICALM is\n                             involved in multiple pathways of AD pathogenesis. PICALM regulates pathways related to APP\n                               processing and Aβ-related neurodegeneration (shown in pink). PICALM plays critical role related to\n                              both tau and Aβ pathologies, such as cholesterol dyshomeostasis, inﬂammation, iron dyshomeostasis\n                         and autophagy (yellow). PICALM is also crucial for neuronal toxicity via glial lipid transport,\n                               synaptic functions, glutaminergic transmission and modifying Aβ-toxicity (blue).Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                            19 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   5. Conclusions\n\n                               Multiple lines of evidence suggest that human PICALM polymorphism modulates\n                 AD pathogenesis. PICALM is involved not only in Aβ production and clearance but also\n                              in tau-mediated neurodegeneration and in endocytic homeostasis. The exact role of the\n                       polymorphism on PICALM expression may vary in different cell types and contribute\n                              to multiple pathways in AD pathological mechanisms. Further studies are necessary\n                              to decipher the AD-speciﬁc post-translational modiﬁcations and the functional roles of\n                         LOAD-related susceptibility alleles to provide mechanistic insights into the pathological\n                            dysregulation of PICALM.\n\n\n                           Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:\n                              //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells11243994/s1, Table S1: Summary statistics for SNPs reaching\n                           genome-wide signiﬁcance.

PICALM is necessaryCells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                             4 of 26\n\n\n\n                               for clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane by binding to AP2 and clathrin (Figure 2A).\n                   PICALM interacts simultaneously with AP1 and clathrin at the trans-Golgi network in\n                      HeLa cells [43]. Several independent studies have reported that the depletion of PICALM\n                            leads to an increase in the size of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and to an increase in\n                            heterogeneity in the CCVs shape in cultured cells of rat hippocampus [46] and of HeLa\n                                  cells [43,47]. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PICALM disruption also leads to an increase in the\n                       number of early endosomes in HeLa cells [48]. A similar observation was obtained by the\n                            depletion of uncoordinated protein-11 (unc-11), the ortholog of PICALM in neurons of C.\n                               elegans [49]. Another study suggests that PICALM is required for efﬁcient clathrin coat\n                           maturation in ﬁbroblasts [50].\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Figure 2. PICALM regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and autophagy. (A) PICALM is involved\n                                  in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) as a clathrin adaptor by facilitating the formation of clathrin-\n                              coated vesicles (CCVs). The interaction between PICALM, adaptor proteins (AP) and clathrin is\n                                      critical to maintaining the form and sizes of CCVs. PICALM interacts with AP2 at the plasma\n                        membrane and AP 1 in the trans-Golgi network to form CCVs. (B) PICALM is also involved in\n                               multiple steps of autophagy process. PICALM is involved in the autophagy precursor formation at\n                                the autophagosome-lysosome fusion [51], maturation of Cathepsin D and lysosomal function [48].\n\n                                   2.1.2. PICALM, Hematopoiesis, Transferrin-Uptake and Cholesterol Homeostasis\n\n                          Chromosomal translocations of PICALM have been observed in patients with acute\n                           lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia [52]. In mice, nonsense point muta-\n                               tions of PICALM cause abnormal iron distribution, growth retardation, shortened life span\n                       and hematopoietic abnormalities [53].\n                       PICALM is a critical protein, and homozygous PICALM knockout mice are dwarfed\n                       and die within 1 month after birth due to a deﬁciency in erythroid maturation and trans-\n                               ferrin uptake [54]. There are controversies in the literature on the effects of PICALM on\n                              transferrin uptake. While some studies suggest that PICALM overexpression or down-\n                           expression did not alter transferrin uptake in HeLa cells or HEK293 cells [55,56], others\n                          observed a signiﬁcant effect on transferrin uptake in the liver, bone marrow and erythroid\n                                   cells from PICALM-deﬁcient mice [50,54]. It is thus speculated that the deletion of PICALM\n                     may be partially compensated by other endocytic proteins in certain types of cells. Indeed,\n                    PICALM is dispensable in myeloid and B-lymphoid development [50].\n                                  Additionally, PICALM also modulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis, as PICALM\n                           expression inﬂuences the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol\n                            biosynthesis and lipoprotein uptake [57].

Tau pathology propagates between neuroanatomically connected\n                            areas throughout the brain during the progression of AD. The stereotypical aspect of tau\n                          pathology progression forms the basis of neuropathological Braak staging of tau pathol-\n                        ogy [10]. The stage of tau pathology better correlates with cognitive decline than Aβ load\n                              in AD patients [9]. Numerous studies have suggested that both synthetic and AD brain-\n                           derived tau ﬁbrils can propagate in a prion-like manner by recruiting normal unfolded tau\n                              into pathological tau aggregates [11].

A number of FAD mutations have been\n                           identiﬁed in the genes of APP, Presenilin1 (PSEN1) and Presenilin2 (PSEN2) (γ-secretase\n                         component) [13].\n                                  Since age is the most important risk factor for AD [14], the great majority of cases, esti-\n                        mated at more than 95%, occur after age 65, constituting late-onset AD (LOAD). There was\n                                        little knowledge of genetic risk factors for LOAD except for Apolipoprotein (APOE) risk allele\n                     APOE4 till the breakthrough made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [15,16]. To\n                              date, GWAS have identiﬁed about 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including\n                       APOE4, BIN1, PICALM, CLU, CR1, ABCA7, TREM2, MS4A and APH1B, with a signiﬁcant\n                              association for LOAD susceptibility [17]. These LOAD-susceptibility genes are functionally\n                           implicated in multiple cellular processes such as synaptic function, lipid metabolism, in-\n                        ﬂammation, endocytosis, cytoskeletal transports, and tau and amyloid pathways in AD\n                             pathologies [18–20]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the GWAS hit genes modulate\n                            the AD risk remain largely elusive and have been under active scrutiny in the ﬁeld of\n                             functional genomics in the post GWAS era. The vast majority of these variants are located\n                              in the noncoding region [21], and such variants are supposed to exert phenotypic effects\n                             via the perturbation of transcriptional gene promoters and enhancers [22].\n                       Among them, several independent GWAS have identiﬁed SNPs signiﬁcantly associ-\n                            ated with LOAD in the PICALM gene (see Section 3.1) coding phosphatidylinositol binding\n                             clathrin-assembly protein PICALM (also known as CALM that stands for clathrin assembly\n                        lymphoid myeloid leukemia)."

ANTH domain contains a\n                                PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domain and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) binding domain.\n                               Clathrin adaptor domain contains several motifs that are critical to interact with endocytic protein,\n                                including DIF, DLL Clathrin binding, DPF, NPF and FESVF motifs. DIF motif binds to AP2. DLL motif\n                                          is conserved and has weak afﬁnity to Clathrin DPF (Aspartic acid-Proline-Phenylalanine) motifs. NPF\n                                (Asparagine-Proline-Phenylalanine) motif binds to AP2 and EH domains (Eps15 Homology domain).\n                            Four phosphorylation sites (S16, Y96, S107 and S303) and two ubiquitination sites (K318 and K324)\n                           have been described in more than 5 references and validated by mass-spectrometry and thus are\n                                highlighted [65]. Altogether, the reported PTMs of PICALM are 41 phosphorylation (S2, S5, T11, S16,\n                               T18, S20, S23, T82, Y88, Y96, S107, Y138, T146, T158, Y237, S297, T301, S303, S307, S308, T312, S315,\n                                S353, T355, T356, S359, T363, T370, T379, S381, S444, S450, S453, T472, S474, K515, K534, S537, S543,\n                            T573 and S645), 15 ubiquitination (K24, K112, K134, K163, K231, K252, K288, K291, K318, K324, K336,\n                             K515, K559, K570 and K571), 1 acetylation (K28), 1 mono-methylation (R9), 1 di-methylation (R636)\n                         and 1 sumoylation (K238).

Three known phosphorylation sites (S16, Y96\n                          and S107) in ANTH domain are highlighted in pink.\n\n                                 In the C-terminal clathrin adaptor domain of PICALM contains critical motifs that\n                          allow PICALM to interact with clathrin and other endocytic machinery proteins. The\n                              clathrin binding motif is DLLDLQ (392–397 in the isoform of 652 amino acids). AP2-\n                           binding motifs are DIF (D375, I376 and F377), DPF (D420, P421 and F422) and FESVF (F489,\n                           E490, S491, V492 and F493).

Since exon 13 contains one DPF (AP2 binding) and one NPF (EH domain\n                            binding) motif, the splice variant without exon 13 is supposed to have reduced interaction\n                          with AP2 and other protein partners owning EH-domains [43].Cells 2022, 11, 3994                                                                                                             7 of 26\n\n\n\n                                   2.3.

The Roles of PICALM in Neuronal Polarity and Synaptic Vesicle Sorting\n\n                       PICALM and its neuronal homolog assembly protein 180 (AP180) have quite inter-\n                              esting functions in neuronal cells. Endocytosis is reduced in PICALM- or AP180-deﬁcient\n                         neurons [58]. Interestingly, PICALM and AP180 have critical roles in establishing the\n                              polarity and neuritic growth in neuronal cells. While treatments with siRNA targeting PI-\n                  CALM lead to dendritic dystrophy, treatments with siRNA targeting AP180 abolish axonal\n                            extension in rat primary neuronal culture. In contrast, neurons overexpressing AP180 or\n                    PICALM generate multiple axons [58].\n                       PICALM is expressed in neurons and is present in synapses [36]. PICALM regulates\n                       membrane fusion by binding to R-SNAREs (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors) such\n                             as VAMP2, VAMP3 and VAMP8 [59,60]. Furthermore, PICALM regulates the internalization\n                             of VAMP2 (Synaptobrevin 2), the most abundant synaptic vesicle protein and a major\n                    R-SNARE component [56]. Since the AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain (see\n                            chapter 2.2) of PICALM interacts with VAMP2, both PICALM and AP180 regulate endocytic\n                              sorting of synaptic vesicles at active zones for neurotransmission [59]. PICALM and related\n                        ANTH-domain-containing proteins modulate the surface levels of calcium-permeable\n                       AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) that mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission\n                       and excitotoxicity [61]. PICALM is thereby supposed to play roles in synaptic plasticity\n                       and learning by modulating both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression\n                         (LTD) [62].\n\n                                   2.1.4. PICALM and Autophagy\n\n                       PICALM plays a key role in multiple steps in autophagy (Figure 2B). PICALM regu-\n                                 lates the endocytosis of VAMP2, VAMP3 and VAMP8, which are essential for the autophagy\n                            process [60]. PICALM knockdown leads to a reduced fusion of autophagosome precursor\n                                 vesicles, which is a VAMP2- and VAMP3-dependent process, and thus decreases autophago-\n                      some biogenesis. PICALM knockdown also inﬂuences the process of autophagosome-\n                          lysosome fusion, which is a VAMP8-dependent process [63]. Therefore, PICALM reduction\n                               results in a general reduction in autophagic ﬂux in HeLa, HEK, CAD and MEF cells [51].\n                             Additionally, PICALM is also implicated in the maturation of Cathepsin D, which is a\n                                   critical lysosomal component [48]. Disruption of exon1 of PICALM leads to deﬁcits in the\n                           maturation of Cathepsin D and autophagy in HeLa cells [48].\n\n                                   2.2. Protein Structure of PICALM\n\n                       PICALM is constituted of an N-terminal ANTH-domain binding phosphatidyl inositol\n                                 4,5 bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and a C-terminal clathrin adaptor domain (Figure 3A) [42,64].\n                            The ANTH domain is a membrane-binding domain with speciﬁcity for phosphatidyli-\n                              nositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and acts as a universal adaptor for nucleation of\n                               clathrin coats. In silico modeling of N-terminal ANTH domain suggests a structure consist-\n                            ing of 11 α-helices [60] (Figure 3B). The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding residues (Kx9Kx(K/R)(H/Y)\n                             are present on several helices. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sites contain evolutionally con-\n                          served basic amino acid residues (K28, K38, K40 and K41, numbering according to the\n                   PICALM isoform of 652 amino acids) forming a positively charged patch on the surface\n                              to interact with phosphates of PtdIns(4,5)P2 [64]. The ANTH domain also contains the\n                           binding region for R-SNARE proteins, and PICALM can bind simultaneously PtdIns(4,5)P2\n                       and VAMP"
